# Getting Start with OSRM 
I met a lot of issues when I started the OSRM learning/research, so I built this document to help newcomers to avoid them.      
Moreover, also some experiences recoreded.       
Welcome everyone to make this document up to date!    
- Based on revision: `commit e5d8319c43b454642079f66b930ac73803840e2b`    

## What is OSRM? 
I assume you already know basically what OSRM is.    
If not, please start from :    
- read the [main page of osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)    
- try the [demo server of OSRM](http://map.project-osrm.org/)    
- quick view the [OSRM API Documentation](http://project-osrm.org/)    

There're totally 2 main repos for OSRM project, i.e. [osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) and [osrm-frontend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-frontend). What we will focus on is the [osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) repo, i.e. the routing engine.       

OSRM is designed to run on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. For a quick introduction about how the road network is represented in OpenStreetMap and how to map specific road network features have a look at [this guide about mapping for navigation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/mapping-for-navigation/).    

There're also a lot of documents on [osrm-backend wiki page](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki) which are very valuable for a quick view.    

## Building from Source and Debugging    
Even OSRM provide docker image to help us build our own OSRM service easier, build and debug the source code will help us to understand the project deeply.    

### Building   
Before you start, please     
- use a Mac    
    - Actually OSRM can be built and run on many platforms, e.g. MacOSX, kinds of Linux, even native Windows (may not work, see [Windows Compilation](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Windows-Compilation)). But for debug the project, it's better to have a Mac with Xcode.    
- familiar with modern C++ (C++11/14)    
- install pre-requirements: latest `git, cmake`    

Refer to below links for other dependencies and build steps:    
- [Build from Source](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend#building-from-source)    
- [Building-OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Building-OSRM)    

### Generate Xcode Project    
The current default build steps on MacOSX will not generate Xcode project. Also, try to generate Xcode project by `cmake -G Xcode` command can not work(see the still opened issue [How to create Xcode project of osrm-backend on mac](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/2409)).      
Fortunately @springmeyer have found the reason and give a temp workaround for us(please also refer to the answer from @springmeyer in [How to create Xcode project of osrm-backend on mac](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/2409)):   
1. Create an empty `src/dummpy.cpp`   
2. Apply this patch
1) cd src/
2) make a file with below content that save to workaround.dff
3) git apply workaround.dff
```diff

     execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_C_COMPILER} -fuse-ld=gold -Wl,--version ERROR_QUIET OUTPUT_VARIABLE LD_VERSION)      
```
3.  Then this works: 
```
Dependency (for mac)
brew install cmake (brew upgrade cmake, if it's already installed)
brew install boost (> 1.50)
```
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Xcode
cmake --build .
open build/OSRM.xcodeproj
```
If Intel TBB NOT found, then build cmake with -DENABLE_MASON=On which should use TBB from mason
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -G Xcode -DENABLE_MASON=ON -DBUILD_TOOLS=1
open build/OSRM.xcodeproj
```

### Run and Debug   
There're several runable binaries, i.e. `osrm-components, osrm-contract, osrm-customize, osrm-datastore, osrm-extract, osrm-io-benchmark, osrm-partition, osrm-routed`, most of them are used for pre-processing map data.    
- `osrm-extract`: Extract the road network(routing data) into a normalized format. It parses the contents of the exported OSM file and writes out routing metadata. More detailed refer to [Extracting the Road Network (osrm-extract)](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Running-OSRM#extracting-the-road-network-osrm-extract).    
- For the MLD(Multi-Level Dijkstra) pipeline we need to extract (`osrm-extract`) a graph out of the OpenStreetMap base map, then partition (`osrm-partition`) this graph recursively into cells, customize the cells (`osrm-customize`) by calculating routing weights for all cells.    
    - i.e. MLD data pre-processing pipeline: `osrm-extract`->`osrm-partition`->`osrm-customize`    
- For CH(Contraction Hierarchies) the partition and customize pipeline stage gets replaced by adding shortcuts from the Contraction Hierarchies algorithm (`osrm-contract`).   
    - i.e. CH data pre-processing pipeline: `osrm-extract`->`osrm-contract`    

Please have a try by the [Run the routing engine](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Running-OSRM)    

#### Debug in Xcode    
- Open the Xcode project    
- choose the target you wanted(e.g. `osrm-routed`)    
- set the command line parameter: `Edit Scheme -> Run -> Arguments -> Arguments Passed On Launch`    
- Run    
- Enjoy!     

#### Download OSM data    
Exported OSM data files can be obtained from providers such as [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/).     
I have tried to download the `.osm.pbf` file from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/), it works!    

### If you still want to debug on native Windows    
I also tried this on my Windows 10, so far it works.     
- Build with VS2015    
    - There're some dependencies will be downloaded while run this `build-local.bat`. Some of them you may already have and want to avoid the redundant download, you can try to edit the `build-local.bat` and `appveyor-build.bat`.    
        - e.g. If already have `cmake`, change the `SET CMAKE_VERSION=3.9.2` with your current cmake version.    
```
cd osrm-backend
./build-local.bat 
```    
- Open Visual Studio 2015 Solution: `./build/OSRM.sln`    
- Set Configuration to `RelWithDebInfo` (`Debug` build failed)    
- Set `osrm-routed` as Startup Project    
- Enjoy!    

## Reading Code   
The document [OSRM Processing Flow](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Processing-Flow) is a description from importing raw OSM data, to computing routes and serving requests. Very valuable for reference.
[Graph representation](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Graph-representation) describe basic graph structure of OSRM.

### osrm-routed   
This is a demo HTTP server on top of `libosrm` library, the core routing service engine. More detailed refer to [Running the Engine via a HTTP Server (osrm-routed)](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Running-OSRM#running-the-engine-via-a-http-server-osrm-routed).
