# Interaction Between C++ and Lua In OSRM
This document will describe how do `C++` and `Lua` work together in [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend).     
Please read [OSRM Profiles](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md) to get understanding of why need `Lua` profiles and how does it work.     
In practice, the `Lua` profiles actually will be integrated by `C++` codes. I.e. it will be loaded by `C++`, and the main functions(`setup()/process_node()/process_way()/process_turn()/process_segment()`) also will be called by `C++`(`osrm-extract`).     

## Lua Functions Brief
Terminologies(e.g. OSM node, OSM way, Segment, etc.) can refer to [Understanding OSRM Graph Representation - Terminology](https://github.com/Telenav/open-source-spec/blob/master/osrm/doc/understanding_osrm_graph_representation.md#terminology).    

| `Lua` Functions    | Link to OSRM Profiles | Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
|`setup()`           |[OSRM profiles - setup](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md#setup)|The `setup` function is called once when the profile is loaded and must return a table of configurations. <br>Note that processing of data is parallelized and several unconnected LUA interpreters will be running at the same time. The `setup` function will be called once for each. Each `LUA` interpreter will have its own set of globals.|
|`process_node()`    |[OSRM profiles - process_node](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md#process_nodeprofile-node-result-relations)|Process an OSM node to determine whether this node is a unable-to-pass barrier or can be passed and whether passing it incurs a delay. <br> More specifically, it will return one boolean and one direction enum:<br>- `barrier`: indicate a unable-to-pass barrier <br>- `traffic_lights`: indicate more delay while passing|
|`process_way()`     |[OSRM profiles - process_way](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md#process_wayprofile-way-result-relations)|Given an OSM way, the `process_way` function will either return nothing (meaning we are not going to route over this way at all), or it will set up a result hash. <br> More specifically, <br>- return `false`: the whole way can not be passed. <br>- otherwise: set some attributes in `result` to indicate whether routable and the routable `speed`/`rate` for each direction, e.g. `forward_mode`, `backward_mode`, `forward_speed`, `backward_speed`, `forward_rate`, `backward_rate`, `weight`, `duration`, etc. |
|`process_turn()`    |[OSRM profiles - process_turn](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md#process_turnprofile-turn)|The `process_turn` function is called for every possible turn in the network. Based on the angle and type of turn you assign the weight and duration of the movement.|
|`process_segment()` |[OSRM profiles - process_segment](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/profiles.md#process_segmentprofile-segment)|The `process_segment` function is called for every segment of OSM ways. A segment is a straight line between two OSM nodes. <br>As you can see, this is NOT currently used in the `car.lua` profile.|


## Lua Scripting Environment Initialization
`Lua` profile will be loaded and referenced by `C++` object `ScriptingEnvironmentLua`.     
Below describes flow chart of the method `Sol2ScriptingEnvironment::InitContext()`.

## Invoke Lua Functions In osrm-extract
The most important methods provided by `Lua` profiles are `process_node()/process_way()/process_turn()/process_segment()`. All of these functions will be Invoked in `osrm-extract` processing.     
Please refer to below call graph for `osrm-extract` processing, **purple** comments in the graph describes where the `Lua` functions be Invoked.

## API Version
API Version is the one designed for compatibility, what if parameters have been changed? Would mapping be hide in this function. Like ProcessNode is the old api, letâ€™s say it support 2 parameters but new api restrictions support 3:

                                      const ExtractionRelationContainer &relations)
{
    BOOST_ASSERT(state.lua_state() != nullptr);

    switch (api_version)
    {
    case 4:
    case 3:
        node_function(profile_table, node, result, relations);
        break;
    case 2:
        node_function(profile_table, node, result);
        break;
    case 1:
    case 0:
        node_function(node, result);
        break;
    }
}
